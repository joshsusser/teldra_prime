rcov_plugin
===========

This is a simple task plugin for rails that adds some useful rcov tasks. The tasks and their descriptions are:

rake test:coverage                # Tests coverage on the entire application
rake test:coverage:units          # Tests coverage for unit tests
rake test:coverage:functionals    # Tests coverage for functional tests
rake test:coverage:integration    # Tests coverage for integration tests

The task ends up creating a coverage folder with an html coverage report in it.

Requirements
============

This task requires that you have rcov installed and on your path.
